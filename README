TextureTest Structure:

Materials now all contain 2 objects: 
-Texture
-Shader

The texture contains the graphics that will be drawn.  A movietexture, for instance, will update its bitmap every frame, while a bitmap texture will simply hold a bitmap.  Moreover, a texture has color, which can be set for ColorMaterial, for instance.

My thought is to add all textures to a globalmanager which will update them every frame appropriately.  Really only needed for MovieTextures.  This will also allow for easy sharing of textures to save on time/speed.

Shaders take the bitmap (or color or whatever) from the texture and "process" them somehow - returning a new result that is set to the drawProperties of the material - which is used for the final render to screen.


*NOTE - actually think i will move drawProperties/clear into the shader itself, so that it can just easily manage that.  ie: a colorshader can set a graphicsolidfill instead, and dont have to have conditionals
